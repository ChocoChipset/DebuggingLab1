# Introduction

We have six different activities on debbuging. Each one presents a specific scenario that requires a different strategy in order to be solved.


### Exercise 0

1. What seems to be the problem in this case? 
1. What's the name of this error, and how can it be solved?

### Exercise 1

1. What caused the `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` error?
1. How can it be debugged and solved?

### Exercise 2  

1. What's the exception raised?
2. How can you determine which line is raising this exception?

### Exercise 3 

1. How could youo print the sequence of numbers in the console without modifying the actual code?

### Exercise 4

There is an array of NSNumbers that includes one NSString.

1. How could you could stop breakpoint only for the string?

### Exercise 5 

The background color of the view is never changed.

1. How could you reach that path of the code using a breakpoint?
